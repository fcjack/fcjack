### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ’»

I'm Jackson, and I'm Brazilian based in Berlin, Germany.

Currently working as Senior Software Engineer @Grafana, previously worked as SRE/Tech Lead @Lykon, I also worked as Backend Engineer @N26 and @Klarna,
mainly focused on improve team performance, developer experience and good practices inside the teams that I worked.

I enjoy distributed systesm, solving complex problems, improve teams performance and experience with different tools and automation.
Thinking about automation, yeah I don't like manual work much, ðŸ˜„!
